## What is the ST4RE Stack?

The "ST4RE Stack" is a monorepo stack I made as a boilerplate for my web development side projects. It consists of:

- Solid.js
- tRPC
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Turborepo
- Solid Router
- Express.js

## Getting Started

To get started using the ST4RE Stack, run the following command

```bash
npx degit danecwalker/st4re-stack
```

The monorepo uses pnpm for package management
